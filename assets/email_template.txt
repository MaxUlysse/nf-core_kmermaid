--
nf-core/kmermaid is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data at the National Genomics Infrastructure at SciLifeLab Stockholm, Sweden.
The pipeline uses Nextflow, a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.
